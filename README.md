# USAddressParser

Fork of the abandoned google code project. Naive/simple US Address parser based on regular expressions and simple heuristics. 
This was created by slava.kovalenko@yahoo.com I only created this project to mavenize it for use as a sample address parser in my syngen project.

There is a scala fork/port that has some updates and bugfixes [here](https://github.com/mephicide/USAddressParser) but I have not pulled all of them into this

This is published to maven central repo as:
```xml
<groupId>com.github.steveash.addr</groupId>
<artifactId>us-address-parser</artifactId>
<version>0.1</version>
```
